Basic Concepts of cryptography
1. Hash - sha256-> digest, sha(standard hashing algorithm)

2. Salt - random num added to hash to increase security

3. HMAC - Hash Based Message Authentication Code -> Key for your Hash

4. Symmetric Encryption - cipher(randomized) & key to encrypt & decrypt messages. IV- Initial vector

5. Keypairs

6. Asymmetric Encryption

7. Signing
